# Example Motiv Project
This is an example project to allow candidates to demonstrate technical ability with a Razor project.

The intent behind the test is to demonstrate an ability to work with HTML, CSS and C#.

# Base Guidelines:
You are presented with a greenfield project and tasked with the following:
1) Create a new Razor page that contains a form to take in a small amount of personal and financial details, ensure this page can be navigated to from the homepage
2) On form submit, redirect to a result page that displays an example finance product that can change based on financial input from step 1 (financial accuracy is optional)
3) Create a new Razor page that displays user details fetched from an API (E.g. you can use https://randomuser.me/api/ to get a random user JSON), ensure this page can be navigated to from the homepage

# Suggestions
3) For steps (1), (2) and (3) consider how you would use CSS to improve the UI, particularly around mobile/tablet/desktop scaling (e.g. Media queries)
4) Comments can be added to code to justify decisions taken/shortcuts for time/etc
5) Where possible, consider making use of the app.settings file (E.g. for the URL in step 3)
6) Evidence of dependency injection is preferable
